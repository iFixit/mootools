## Mootools Core + More v1.6.0

This repo serves as documentation of our custom build of Mootools, done
using the [Builder utility](http://mootools.net/core/builder) on the Mootools website.

## Core Modules

Everything.

Patched `Element.getProperty` to return the `Element` when called without arguments. This is a hack to fix a bug; see https://github.com/iFixit/mootools/pull/3 for details.

## More Modules

See this link for a list of modules that ARE included in our version MooTools-More-1.6.0.js:
